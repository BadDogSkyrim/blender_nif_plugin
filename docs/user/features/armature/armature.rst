Bone Flags
----------
.. _armature-boneflags:

* These are set upon export if left at 0.

Dismember Flags
---------------
.. _armature-dismemberflags:

* Currently does nothing - in testing.

Inventory Marker
----------------
.. _armature-invmarker:

* This is a special type of bone which is used to position object in the inventory display. 
* It may also be used for animation placement involving multiple NPCs
* The InvMarker bone should only be used in engines that can support them.

**Example:**
	
#. Create this item in the same manner as you would for a standard armature bone.
#. Parent must be Armature root.
#. Naming must start with InvMarker and can only be appended with .000
	A model with 4 inventory marker bone items should be named as InvMarker, InvMarker.001, InvMarker.002, InvMarker.003 
	
**Notes:**

*	Games known to support this include: The Elder Scrolls - Skyrim.
*	Exporting this type of bone into engines that do not support it will cause crashes.

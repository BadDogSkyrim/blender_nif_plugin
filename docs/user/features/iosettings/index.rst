Import and Export Settings
--------------------------
.. _user-features-iosettings:

This section explains the import and export settings.

Common Settings
***************

There are some common settings shared between the import and export operators.

Log Level
---------
.. _user-features-iosettings-loglevel:

Log Level
* The level at which a log entry is generated. This is used for debugging and error checking. 
* As a user you will only need to alter this setting if you experience an issue during the import it and a developer asks for more detailed logs than are produced with the default logging level.

.. warning::
   Only a subset of these settings are currently supported even though they have been documented. 
   This is due to the fact that they are ported directly from the old plugin and as such, will functionally remain the same.
